# Lesson System Documentation

## Overview

The PolyChord v2 lesson system is designed with **complete user freedom** in mind. All lessons and sections are unlocked by default, allowing learners to access any content at any time without prerequisites.

## Key Features

### ðŸ”“ All Lessons Unlocked
- **No lesson locking mechanism**: Every lesson and section is accessible from the start
- **No prerequisites**: Users don't need to complete earlier lessons to access later ones
- **Full freedom**: Learners can jump between any lessons, categories, or difficulty levels

### ðŸ§­ Continue Learning Guidance
- **Smart recommendation**: The green "Continue Learning" button guides users to their next uncompleted lesson
- **Optional guidance**: This is a suggestion, not a requirement - users can ignore it and choose any lesson
- **Progress tracking**: The system tracks completion but doesn't enforce sequential learning

### ðŸ“š Flexible Learning Paths
- **Browse by category**: Users can explore lessons organized by topic (animals, food, travel, etc.)
- **Filter by difficulty**: Choose beginner, intermediate, or advanced levels independently
- **Search functionality**: Find specific lessons by name or content
- **Grid/List views**: Customize the lesson display to preference

## Technical Implementation

### useLessons Hook
```typescript
// All lessons created with isLocked: false
isLocked: false // All lessons are unlocked by default - users can access any lesson
```

### LessonSelector Component
- Displays all lessons as clickable and accessible
- "Continue Learning" button finds the first uncompleted lesson
- No UI restrictions based on completion status

### Progress Tracking
