# PolyChord v2 - Local User Profile Implementation

## Overview

The application has been successfully modified to remove the sign-up/registration system and implement a local user profile system that saves learning progress locally without requiring a server.

## Changes Made

### 1. Authentication System Overhaul

**Removed:**
- User registration/sign-up functionality
- Email/password authentication
- Multiple user accounts system

**Added:**
- Simple local user profile creation
- Single user per device
- Local storage for all user data

### 2. New Components

#### `UserSetup.tsx`
- **Purpose**: Initial user setup when no profile exists
- **Features**:
  - Name input
  - Native language selection
  - Target language selection
  - Modern, clean UI with gradient design
  - Form validation

#### `UserProfile.tsx` 
- **Purpose**: Profile management and settings view
- **Features**:
  - Display user information
  - Show all language pairs and progress
  - Progress statistics overview
  - Reset profile functionality (with confirmation)
  - Language pair management

### 3. Modified Components

#### `AuthContext.tsx`
- **Simplified Methods**:
  - `createUser()` - Creates a new local user profile
  - `resetUser()` - Clears all local data and resets the app
  - Removed `login()`, `register()`, `logout()`
- **Features**:
  - Automatic daily progress tracking
  - Streak calculation
  - Language pair migration for existing users
  - All data stored in local storage

#### `App.tsx`
- **Updated Flow**:
  - Shows `UserSetup` if no user profile exists
  - Directly loads app with user data if profile exists
  - Added new 'profile' view
- **Navigation**: Added profile view to main navigation

#### `Sidebar.tsx`
- **Added**: Profile menu item with User icon
- **Updated**: ViewType to include 'profile'

## User Experience Flow

### First Time Users
1. App loads and shows `UserSetup` component
2. User enters their name, selects native and target languages
3. Profile is created and stored locally
4. App automatically loads with the new profile

### Returning Users
1. App automatically loads with stored user profile
2. Daily progress tracking updates streaks
3. All learning progress is preserved locally
4. Can access profile settings via sidebar

### Profile Management
1. Click "Profile" in the sidebar
2. View all user information and progress
3. See language pairs and statistics
4. Option to reset profile (with confirmation warning)

## Data Storage

All user data is stored in the browser's local storage:
- **Key**: `polychord_user`
- **Contains**: Complete user profile with progress, language pairs, preferences
- **Persistence**: Data persists across browser sessions
- **Privacy**: All data stays on the user's device

## Technical Benefits

1. **No Server Required**: Completely client-side application
2. **Privacy First**: No user data leaves the device
3. **Offline Ready**: Works without internet connection
4. **Simple Deployment**: Can be hosted on any static hosting service
5. **Fast Loading**: No authentication delays

## Important Notes

- **Data Loss Warning**: Users should be warned that clearing browser data will reset their progress
- **Backup**: Consider adding export/import functionality for user data in the future
- **Multiple Devices**: Users cannot sync progress across devices (by design)
- **Browser Specific**: Progress is tied to the specific browser/device combination

## Future Enhancements

1. **Export/Import**: Allow users to backup and restore their progress
2. **Multiple Profiles**: Support for multiple users on the same device
3. **Progressive Web App**: Add PWA features for better mobile experience
4. **Offline Vocabulary**: Cache vocabulary data for offline use

The application now provides a streamlined, privacy-focused learning experience without the complexity of user management systems while maintaining all the core learning functionality.
